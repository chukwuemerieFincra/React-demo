            We kept hearing the same story: a mother arrives at the hospital,
            ready to deliver — and the family scrambles for funds they hadn't
            had time to prepare. That moment shouldn't be defined by financial
            panic.

          <p>
            In Nigeria and Africa at large, maternal health outcomes are still
            deeply shaped by access to information and financial readiness. Many
            mothers begin their pregnancies without a clear guide, without
            knowing what to expect week to week, and without a structured way to
            prepare for the costs of delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
            We built MaternalPath out of a desire to bridge that gap — to give
            every pregnant woman a trusted companion through her journey. One
            that doesn't just inform, but that supports, guides, and prepares
            her emotionally and financially.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because every mother deserves to walk into delivery day feeling
            ready, informed, and supported — not anxious and unprepared.
